# Real-time Augmented Reality Filters using Deep Learning and OpenCV

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing real-time augmented reality (AR) using Python and OpenCV. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the system overlays virtual elements onto the live camera feed, enhancing the user's perception of the physical environment. The project facilitates real-time image processing for feature detection and tracking, allowing the AR application to recognize and interact with objects in the environment, providing an immersive and dynamic user experience.
